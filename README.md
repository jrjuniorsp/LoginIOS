# LoginIOS

This is an example showing how to create a Login Page in iOS using Swift 2.1.

This project uses Alamofire and SwiftyJSON frameworks. Both are being managed by cocoapods.

The Server Side component has been created using Node.JS and it is hosted on Heroku at the following URL: https://jr-login.herokuapp.com. Please, access it before testing the app

There is only one valid user/password, which is: username: batman, password: 1234

I hope this code can be useful for anyone else.
